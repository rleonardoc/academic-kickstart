I am an avid reader − averaging a book a week since 2018 – and a fanatic of astrophysics. I practice soccer at a semi-pro level, frequently bet on soccer games, dance to latin music every now and then, trade binary options and spend quality time with family and friends. I am dedicated, disciplined, resilient and curious, having immovable principles and values and an unstoppable willpower oriented towards what I want to achieve.
