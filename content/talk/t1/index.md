# We are getting published!

It took us ten weeks of hardwork, as part of the [Research in Industrial Projects for Students](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019/) program, jointly supported by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA, GumGum Inc., and NSF Grant $$\langle$$DMS$$\rangle$$ 1440415. But who is us?

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy
